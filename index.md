# Welcome to ModisWorks

ModisWorks is the home of Modis, a highly modular Python Discord bot designed to be easily privately hosted by anyone. At ModisWorks, we have three primary goals that we hope to achieve with Modis:

1. Create a Discord bot that is simple enough to host so that someone with no experience in server administration can host it on their own.
2. Create a Discord bot that is simple enough to develop for so that someone with no experience in software development can learn to write a simple module.
3. Create an easy to understand but highly functional platform for developers of all levels to learn and develop their programming skill on something that has real-world applications.

## Getting started

To get started hosting your own version of Modis, check out the [Setup](./doc/guides/setup.md) guide.

## Custom modules

If you're interested in making your own modules for Modis, have a look at the [Ping Pong Module](./doc/guides/ping-pong.md) guide.

## Currently available modules

There are currently 9 modules in Modis:

- `bethebot`
- `gamedeals`
- `help`
- `hex`
- `manager`
- `music`
- `replies`
- `rocketleague`
- `tableflip`

### bethebot

bethebot let's the bot's owner send messages as Modis.

### gamedeals

gamedeals uses Reddit to find the best game deals.

### help

help lists the help commands for all modules, as well as the commands for specific modules.

### hex

hex looks for hex values in your messages, and displays a solid block image if it finds a value. hex works with any 3 or 6 digit hex values starting with '#' or '0x'.

### manager

manager allows users to activate and deactivate modules within a server, and change the server prefix for Modis.

### music

music plays videos and playlists from YouTube, and music files stored on the internet.

### rocketleague

rocketleague lets you look up player's Rocket League stats.

## Documentation

More detailed information about each module can be found in the [Documentation](https://infraxion.github.io/modis/documentation/#modules).
